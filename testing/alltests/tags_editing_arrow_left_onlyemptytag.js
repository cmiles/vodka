/*
Verifies that if you're tag editing and you have an empty tag, and you hit left, and there are no other tags, you don't get in a weird state (like 2 empty tags, or a state where you're tag editing but there are no tags so the interface is frozen).

Note: it's okay for the normal golden to not be in normal mode, this is due to the fact that currently, esc doesn't work when tag editing.
